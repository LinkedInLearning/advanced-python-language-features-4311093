# define two lists of numbers

odds = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]

# Perform a mapping and filter function on a list
evenSquared = list(
    map(lambda e: e**2, filter(lambda e: e > 4 and e < 16, evens)))
print(evenSquared)

# Derive a new list of numbers from a given list
evenSquared = [e ** 2 for e in evens]
print(evenSquared)

# Limit the items operated on with a predicate condition
oddSquared = [e ** 2 for e in odds if e > 3 and e < 17]
